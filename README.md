## Description

Keystone Roulette adds a bit of excitement to your Mythic+ runs by randomly selecting a keystone from your party members.

* Gather keystone information from everyone in your group.
* Choose a keystone at random.
* Announce the chosen dungeon in party chat, along with a fun, randomized message.

No more arguments, no more indecision â€“ just pure, unadulterated dungeon-running fun!
